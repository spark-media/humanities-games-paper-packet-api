## humanities.games - Paper Packet Processing

Empower students to learn by remixing HTML5 games with their own researched and created content (built for WordPress Multisite). 

This API is primarily for visibility into the logic that extracts art from paper packets, using OpenCV. You could use this as a model to develop your own solution.

Installation of this version requires an Amazon Web Services account and significant modifications. If you are just looking to use the service, email info@humanities.games for a free API key.

This project is supported by the National Endowment for the Humanities.
